a/ the script aims to print the players name and the number of goals they have scored

	ex:

	ronaldo 10
	Messi	10
	Bob		0

b/ 501 dbQuery() is being executed. 
	
	the first dbQuery() is called outside the loop
	then in the loop, dbQuery is called exactly 500 times, as there are 500 players

c/ 
<?

$q = "select p.name, count(g.id) from players p left join goals g on (p.id = g.scoredby) group by p.id, p.name"

$r = dbQuery($db, mkSQL($q));

while ($t = dbNext($r)) {

	list($name,$goal) = $t;

	printf("%s %d\n", $name, $goal);
}
?>
