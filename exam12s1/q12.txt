	RedPart = Proj[pid] (Sel[color='red'] (Parts))

	SuppyRed = RedPart join[RedPart.pid=Catalog.part] Catalog

	SupplierName = Proj[sname] (SuppyRed join[SuppyRed.supplier = Suppliers.sid] Suppliers)


Find the sids of suppliers who supply some red or green part.
	
	RGpart = Sel[color = 'red' or color = 'green'](Parts)

	RGSupplier = Proj[supplier] (RGpart join[RGpart.pid = Catalogs.part] Catalogs)

	Sname = Proj[sname] (Suppliers join[Suppliers.sid = RGSupplier.supplier] RGSupplier)


Find the sids of suppliers who supply some red part or whose address is 221 Packer Street.

	Rpart = Sel[color = 'red'](Parts)

	RSupplier = Proj[supplier] (Rpart join[Rpart.pid = Catalogs.part] Catalogs)

	ASupplier = Proj[sid] (Sel[address = '221 Packer Street'](Supplier))

	result = RSupplier union ASupplier 

Find the sids of suppliers who supply some red part and some green part.

	Rpart = Sel[color = 'red'](Parts)

	RSupplier = Proj[supplier] (Rpart join[Rpart.pid = Catalogs.part] Catalogs)

	Gpart = Sel[color = 'green'](Parts)

	RSupplier = Proj[supplier] (Rpart join[Rpart.pid = Catalogs.part] Catalogs)

	result = RSupplier intersect RSupplier

Find the sids of suppliers who supply every part.

	everyPart = Proj[pid] Parts

	SupplierPart = Proj[supplier,part]

	supplier = Proj[supplier] (SupplierPart div everyPart)





f. Find the sids of suppliers who supply every red or green part.

	Rpart = Rename[part] (Proj[pid] Sel[color = 'red'](Parts))

	SupplierPart = Proj[supplier,part]

	supplier = Proj[supplier] (SupplierPart div Rpart)





h. Find the sids of suppliers who supply every red or green part.

	Rpart = Rename[part] (Proj[pid] Sel[color = 'red'](Parts))

	Gpart = Rename[part] (Proj[pid] Sel[color = 'green'](Parts))

	SupplierPart = Proj[supplier,part]

	RSupplier = Proj[supplier] (SupplierPart div Rpart)

	GSupplier = Proj[supplier] (SupplierPart div Gpart)

	Result = RSupplier union GSupplier

i. Find the pids of parts that are supplied by at least two different suppliers.
	
	C1 = Catalog
	C2 = Catalog

	result = Sel[c1.sid != c2.sid] (C1 join[c1.pid = c2.pid] C2)

a.Find the ids of pilots certified for 'Boeing 747' aircraft.

	aid_ = proj[aid] (sel[aname = 'Boeing 747'](Aircraft))

	result = proj[employee] (Certified join[aid_.aid = Certified.aircraft] aid_)

b. Find the names of pilots certified for 'Boeing 747' aircraft.

	Stage1 = Proj[eid](Sel[aname='Boeing 747'](Aircraft Join Certified))

	result = Proj[enam] (Stage1 join[eid] Employee)

c. Find the ids of all aircraft that can be used on non-stop flights from New York to Los Angeles.

	proj[aid] (Aircraft join [cruisingRange > distance] (Sel[from = 'New York' and to = 'LA'](Flight)))

d. Identify the flights that can be piloted by a pilot whose salary is more than $100,000.
	
	(Aircraft join [cruisingRange > distance] (Flight)) 

	Stage1 = proj[aircraft] (Certifed join[employee=eid] proj[eid](Sel[salary > 100000](Employee)))
	Stage2 = proj[cruisingRange] (Stage1 join [aid=aircraft] Aircraft)
	res = proj[flno](Stage2 join[cruisingRange > distance] Flight)

g. Find the ids of employees who make the highest salary.

	LowerPaid = E1 join[E1.salary < E2.salary] E2
	highestPaid = Proj[eid](Employees) - Proj[eid](LowerPaid)







R1 = GroupBy[employee,Count[employee]](Certified)
R2 = Rename[1->employee,2->ncertified](R1)
R3 = Max[ncertified](R2)
Answer = Sel[ncertified=R3](R1)
