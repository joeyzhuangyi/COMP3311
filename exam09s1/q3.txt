(b)

dbQuery is going to be call 501 times.
the first time will get be to get 500 players,

$db = dbConnect("dbname=exam");

$query = "select p.name, count(*) 
from players p 
join goals g on (p.id = g.scoredby)
group by p.id;"

$r = dbQuery($db, mkSQL($query))

while ($t = dbNext($r)) {

	list($name,$goal) = $t;
	printf("%s %d\n", $name, $goal);
}
?>
